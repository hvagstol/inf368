- Generate mask output files compatible with R-CNN 

- Load class and class ids from text file
	
- Store species data in settings file and load/parse by species name

- Store camera/setup data in settings file and use for scaling


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
x Check if object is outside vertical edges (horizontal is okay)

x Handle occlusions in mask generation

x Rotate cutouts so that scaling is applied correctly
    x Moment function to calculate principal axis
    x Rotate principal axis to horizontal
	x Crop to bounding box

x Ignore original image size

x Scale according to FoV

x Randomize distance to camera

x Randomize size

x Apply random rotation to object

x Limit scaling by species max size or common size
    
	x Use species common size and normal distribution

x Apply objects in far-to-near order

x Randomize direction (mirror)
