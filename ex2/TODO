x Rotate cutouts so that scaling is applied correctly
    x Moment function to calculate principal axis
    x Rotate principal axis to horizontal
	x Crop to bounding box
	

- Store species data in settings file and load/parse by species name

- Store camera/setup data in settings file and use for scaling

- Limit scaling by species max size or common size
    - Use species common size and normal distribution

 - Randomize distance to camera and scale according to FoV

 - Ignore original image size

 - Apply random rotation to object

 - Check if object is outside vertical edges (horizontal is okay)

 - Randomize distance from camera and apply objects in far-to-near order

 - Randomize direction (mirror)
